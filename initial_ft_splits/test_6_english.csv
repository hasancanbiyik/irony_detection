bet the GOP wont try to repeal the patriot act 42 times.,1
"Believe me, I was furious when our ""socialist"" (I can't roll my eyes at that hard enough) president took single payer off the table before anyone even had to ask him to take it off the table.  We should have nationalized healthcare like every other civilized nation on the planet, but apparently my fellow Americans just don't want it.  They're barely willing to tolerate the incredibly mild reforms in the ACA.  Hell, people are furious at the president because their terrible fake insurance is being replaced by cheaper insurance that actually insures them.  ""But but but you said I could keep eating dirt and paying for the privilege if I wanted!  Liar!  Liar! "" We've been trying for single payer since Teddy Roosevelt's day, and it got him kicked out of his own party.  This sort of ""everything new is pants-pissingly terrifying"" mindset is why we still won't use the damn metric system.  As much as I think my country NEEDS single payer, realistically I have to admit that the majority of us apparently don't WANT it, so I'll take whatever petty improvements we can get.",1
"My friend and I are going to attend a rodeo with one of us wearing an Obama mask and one of us wearing a t-shirt pointing saying ""I'm with stupid"".",0
Obama calls it Obamacare.,1
The left's irrational hatred of Walmart is comical to me.,0
"Graduated high school in 1974, I still use the skills I learned in shop class on a daily basis, yet I have never been called on to ""diagram a sentence"".",0
Republican = bad politicians and Democratic = good politicians?,1
"It would make too much sense to connect all major US cities by rail.  I think that the Airlines and car companies would lobby heavily to make sure this never happens.  Looking at which cities the Highspeed was supposed to connect, it seems it was destined to fail.",1
All you need to do these days is get your income defined as a return on an investment.,0
"Congratulations on your successful surgery, praise God!  Also, you have enough beard to shame an Orthodox priest.",1
Cola costs more per litre than petrol around here.,0
"&gt;$7,000 fine It's insane that one of the largest businesses in the world would refuse to pay this, but it's Walmart.  Is anyone surprised?",1
"Yes, but can it run Minecraft on far?",0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but if I dare bitch about buhraaack between bites of my turkey drumstick I'm right back in the KKK again as far as the libtards are concerned.",1
She made my penis fill with blood!   KILL HER!   THROW STONES AT HER UNTIL SHE IS DEAD ALLAH AHKBAR,1
"Maybe because there are more religious people in the world than there are atheists?  And that lower class countries still have a substantial number of ""religious""(not really religious, just following the flow) people in them?  Also, since the study also includes people in prison, where a lot of people convert because of desperation, its not really reliable in that sense.  Oh, shit sorry, I mean, RELIGION IS BAD AND STUFF RABBLE RABBLE RABLLE!",1
Nah instant 1950's tax rates.,0
"Unless it's Bush's election, but that wasn't really an election since the Supreme Court basically awarded him the office.",0
Funny how religion needs to have a non-suicide clause in the first case.   I guess the mom should have gone ahead and murdered the girl and then asked god for forgiveness.   That's legit by their twisted rules.,1
"unfortunately, it's the right wing that's more likely to invoke christianity or relgion in general, so they kinda have a certain ownership of it.",0
So the question during their Twitter Q&amp;A about washing the sleaze off with a regular shower or with baby tears has been answered... it's baby tears while removing candy from said baby.,1
"Somebody thinks the ""affordable"" premiums will be going up again.",0
*ahem* SPONGE BOB IS A FUCKING CARTOON!!!!!!,0
"Because I've seen this article 10 million times over the past 2 days, I'm just assuming she did it for attention, not because she's genuinely a nutjob.",0
"Thanks CBO, but we already saved $4 billion by taking food out of people's mouths.   We're good.",1
"I'll take this as an improvement of sorts.  Silly as this stuff is, it's far less damaging than organized religion.   It's embarrassing now, but as a teenager I was interested in ""magik"".  I read thousands of pages of Aleister Crowley and even that fake ""Necronomicon"" that used to circulate.  So esoteric.  So cool.   The kids will wise up eventually.  Even if they don't, I'll take goddess worshipers, Tarot readers and other occultists over monotheists any day.  ""Harm ye none, do what ye will"" is far more congenial than the bloody-mindedness of the Bible or Qur'an.",1
Children are more sensible.,1
"It is the difference between me knowing that you are an idiot, and you thinking I am evil.",0

"All I can say is ""ha ha"" they should have read it first.",0
"What I want to know, what has he down that 37% of people approve of?",1
"I observe this every day.  If you talk to a ""right winger"" in Fox news terms, then they *hate* big government, Obama, socialized medicine, taxes, etc etc etc.  Talk to them about *actual* programs, and suddenly they are actually for almost every government program in existence.",1
Correlation does not imply causation.,0
"When you know your religion is wrong and that you spent your life getting on your knees for no reason, you too would resist.",0
"Oh my god what a headache listening to her!   You know what though?  We're going to hear this same stuff from Republicans for the next few weeks.  It's a ""serious investigation"" they are undertaking...  Presented by Miss South Carolina.",1
"Surely they'll offer an ""In TFSM We Trust"" version, right?  Or maybe ""Joseph Smith Lied""?",1
Don't they need it the MOST?,1
Well it's the only way to stop that awful health care bill that they couldn't stop at the ballot box or in court.,1
Hey guys.   Apparently this article meant what it seems and we should all vote it down.,1
"But we know that we would.  We've had marginal rates at that level in the past and our Rockefeller's, Carnegie's and Edison's all stayed.  And people still flooded into this country and tried to be worthy of those high tax rates.",1
"""The Papal Octopus"" would be such a cool band name.",0

This is what you get when Republicans control your state legislature.,0
Im pretty sure that no one takes that guy seriously,0
Good thing he was born in Canada.,1
That's what I'll call my rifle.,0
Sadly his congressional district will keep putting him in office until they nail the box shut.,0
They probably gave him talking points to heckle Obama with to make him a victim and make it look like he's more moderate than he really is.,0
"Whether or not you agree that what they're doing is necessary or good, you've got to admire their willingness to stick to what they think is important.",0

Takers come in all forms.    Vets.   Welfare queens.   Widows.   People who own COLOR TV's.    Orphans.  /s,1
"Perfect example: me.  I pay about $6000 per year for health insurance.    Never had to use it until this year.   (Pain in kidney area, trace amount of blood in urine, dehydrated a lot, working outdoors in the south) Gee, I bet I have a kidney stone...  Google agrees $6000 insurance $1000 deductible $1000 in co-pays, 20% of bills for cancer tests, two rounds of x-rays, ultrasound, etc...  $8000 paid so far.   Guess what?   I have a kidney stone.  Good news, there's a procedure available that smashes the stone, but you have to be anesthetized, needs more tests before we can put you out, bloodwork, EKG...  Another couple hundred dollars.  And the procedure?   I will owe 20%, which is $3000.  I don't have another $3000, so I can't really afford to have it done.   Am I risking future kidney function?   Possibly, yes.  Total bill for kidney stone:  $5000 $6000 for insurance $11,000 Total, if I want treatment.   If not, suffer.   I can't currently afford it, so....  Awesome, huh?  EDIT: Oh BTW, my deductible re-sets at the first of the year, so if I don't get this done before xmas, it will cost $1000 more next year.  TL:DR Fuck you America.   Get your shit together.",1
"I could get behind that.  They make beer for members, sell it to help support their church, and part of the money they bring in goes to the community.  But god still doesn't exist.",1
If they keep this up I might actually start watching Fox again.,0
Let me bully a Park Ranger doing their job under difficult circumstances I helped bring on.  Wait... a different and accurate viewpoint?   I'm out.,1
"For the republicans, probably a crazy fuck that has zero chance of being elected in a nation race, but will pull in tons of cash when he runs.",0
