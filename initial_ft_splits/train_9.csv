"I prefer it!  I'm a Texan and a while back I had a HORRIBLE kidney stone but I didn't know what it was because I had never had one before, I went to the ER in EXCRUCIATING pain and they treated me wonderfully!  I got three, count 'em baby three, shots of morphine through an IV, that is an experience I have never had before but enjoyed and would recommend!  Then I left with a handful of prescriptions after a CT scan (is that right?  Some kind of scan! ) and went home and was high as a kite for a few days and then it passed and we were all good again.  Woo!  So then the bill comes and it's $8000!  So at first I was all like ""woah, shit"" so I called and complained because while in the ER I had specifically ask, repeatedly, how much the scan would cost and had repeatedly had my question refused to be answered by the doctors, nurses, radiologists (or whatever they're called) and even the lady who came in to get my personal info and ask me for a credit card to pay ""as much as I could afford right now"" (I authorized 50$ because she wouldn't explain to me what exactly it was I was paying for ""right now"" and I finally decided they just wanted a card on file).  Sooo when the bill comes the scan ALONE was 6000 bucks, just the scan, the entire rest of my treatment was only 2000 which I would probably have paid gladly after the wonderful care I got (and I knew I was uninsured going into this and I knew ERs are expensive and at the time I was in HORRIBLE pain and scared shitless by it so I didn't care).  I made my choices and would live with them but 6 grand for JUST THE SCAN?  That seemed unreasonable to me and I also found out later that scans like that aren't necessary for kidney stones and often aren't done unless you're peeing blood, so wtf?  So this is where the fun starts, I called to complain about this scan cost, I was quite clear that I would pay a reasonable about for my care and was happy with my care but I couldn't afford 8000 total and that 6k for the scan was nuts, so they ask me to fill out some paperwork to see if I qualified for ""financial relief"" from my bill.  I explained again that I didn't want charity, I just wanted a reasonable bill (and BTW, 2000 for the three shots of morhpine and the 10 minutes the doctor spent with me seems a little out of whack too, 800 of that is called an ""ER fee"" and is apparently a charge you get just for walking into the ER regardless of what happens next, but hey they took good care of me and I don't know what the fuck morphine costs).  Anyway the only option I had was to file for the charitable relief, well ya see I am currently a ""stay at home uncle"" my brother abandoned his two kids with our mom, she can't afford day care (you would not fucking believe how expensive day care is) and since I made less money than she does, I become the stay at home parent.  We all live together now, she pays the bills and I take care of the kids.  It was weird at first but it's actually kinda rewarding and fun now (most of the time).  So technically I'm single with no income and have been for about a year and a half now and my tax returns reflect that.  Actually do have some income for contract IT work with people who knew me before I quit, it's all under the table though.  Soooo I got FULL relief.  I actually have some money and my mother actually makes ""ok"" money and we were willing to pay a reasonable amount for the bill (my hope was to reduce it by half to 4k and pay it out over time, lower is better of course but I had braced myself to accept 4 grand if I could negotiate hard enough to get there).  Instead I paid 0$.  And I learned a valuable lesson, if it looks like you have no money you can go to the ER for freeeeee!  Wee!  So suck it tax payers I ripped you off for 8000 bucks and I have three pain pills left over for a rainy day!  Now stupid Obamacare is going to make me pay for my own insurance :( boooo That's going to be like 70$ a month.  EVERY month!  You even have to pay in December!

"Then why  was Hitler rejected from art school?  :p There are particular facets of Card's books that I find really hard to reconcile with his real life bigotry.   In the later books, Ender is among the most rational and egalitarian characters I have ever read.   Card clearly understands diversity and tolerance better than most people, yet he flat out rejects them.  It's sad how much power Religion has to poison even great minds.",1
"Perfect example: me.  I pay about $6000 per year for health insurance.    Never had to use it until this year.   (Pain in kidney area, trace amount of blood in urine, dehydrated a lot, working outdoors in the south) Gee, I bet I have a kidney stone...  Google agrees $6000 insurance $1000 deductible $1000 in co-pays, 20% of bills for cancer tests, two rounds of x-rays, ultrasound, etc...  $8000 paid so far.   Guess what?   I have a kidney stone.  Good news, there's a procedure available that smashes the stone, but you have to be anesthetized, needs more tests before we can put you out, bloodwork, EKG...  Another couple hundred dollars.  And the procedure?   I will owe 20%, which is $3000.  I don't have another $3000, so I can't really afford to have it done.   Am I risking future kidney function?   Possibly, yes.  Total bill for kidney stone:  $5000 $6000 for insurance $11,000 Total, if I want treatment.   If not, suffer.   I can't currently afford it, so....  Awesome, huh?  EDIT: Oh BTW, my deductible re-sets at the first of the year, so if I don't get this done before xmas, it will cost $1000 more next year.  TL:DR Fuck you America.   Get your shit together.",1
