"From user tilio who deleted his comment after realizing how stupid it was,""as the other side of ""independent,"" i feel the exact opposite.  we're 17 trillion in debt with over 70 trillion in unfunded liabilities (medicare is once again, almost bankrupt).  instead of making efforts to work these down, democrats are piling on even more debt.  it's clear that many democrats / fiscal authoritarians have not looked at this from our point of view.  republicans, tea, and fiscal conservatives in general want spending cuts and deficit reduction.  as long as we stand firm, we win.  either democrats cave to our demands (giving us the spending cuts we want), or democrats drive us off the cliff, destroying the US credit rating, forcing spending cuts because they won't be able to borrow nearly as much money.  the only way we lose is to agree to let democrats / fiscal authoritarians to keep spending.  you may dislike this point of view.  but it is inescapable fact. "" Your joking right?   That debt is largely a legacy of the last president and his two wars, which we had to continue.   Conservative fiscal ideas are what drove us over the edge.   Furthermore, we know your position, but you lost, the majority of voters elected representatives that support the ACA, as evidenced by the wast of time that the republicans tried to remote on it and lost every time.   This is a democracy, just because the majority disagrees with you doesn't mean you get to shut down government and act like a bunch of spoiled children.",1
