This is now officially my favorite novelty account.  [slow clap],1
Does it comes in agp?,1
This is not a checklist.,1
This raised my blood pressure a considerable degree,0
That's a fancy way of saying he lied.,0
That's the quickest way to never get another interview.,0
"Does anybody remember during one of the debates how Obama said he was proud to call it ""Obamacare""?",0
When I see Larry Flynt I'm always disappointed he isn't Woody Harrelson.,0
Insane like a fox.  Ted Cruz is actually very very intelligent.  It's his constituents that are insane.  He's just playing the part.,1
That link is worthy of a post in itself.,0
"Lol good one, let's just round up every last corrupt politician, regulator and law enforcement officer, and throw them in a prison that's totally not built on corruption, and run by corrupt wardens.",1
Hah...  You think Canada has strict regulation of the Financial sector...  adorable.,1
Well I've heard that Mexicans and Blacks smoke it and then want to rape white women.    It'll also be detrimental to the cotton industry...,1
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  HAHAHAHAHA!  HAHA!  HA...  Now I'm sad because this will never happen :(,1
"She's a reformist, not a revolutionary",0
I won't believe the GOP is dead until I see that they have been landslided away in the elections.,0
"And that would make you a homophobic, regressive douche bag with a gay child.",0
"Christians can't be Republicans either, but you don't see that affecting them.   Jesus was all about helping the poor, giving out free healthcare, and kicking the moneychangers out of the temple.   He was also pretty cool with taxes, very anti-war, and non-judgemental.    Doesn't seem to stop Christians any from supporting the political party that's completely Anti-Jesus.",1
Yet another great rant about how Christians suck at being Christians.,0
"Cheney will live forever, because only the good die young.",1
"I think the Republicans make a fatal error when they don't take in to account, human nature.  When you tell people they can't vote, they are sure to show up in droves.",1
"[Sure it will, i believe you](https://www. youtube. com/watch? v=Etbv2HM5qf0&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player)",1
"lol, that's one big massive steaming pile of r/shitpoliticssays",0
"Poor people need food, not Paul Ryan.",0
Perhaps because the whole thing was Koch Brothers Astroturf?,0
Welcome to the wonderful world of Regulatory Capture - it will only get worse as the years pass.,0
I'd like to see her abolish corporate personhood.,1
"Well, to me the immediate problem is that it's faulty to view God as a being among other beings.  God is more like being-itself.  Thus by definition you can't really have a God-eating-penguin.  However, this statement is ridiculing the ""you can't prove God doesn't exist"" argument, which is a bad argument so I don't mind this statement that much.  *Shrugs*",1
Increase the sample size to the last twenty five terms.,0
So they waste billions a year that cannot be accounted for **and** penny pinch by pirating software?,0
"&gt;get off Ohio's dick and let them do what they want to do And while we're at it, let's let the south have slavery again.  Frankly, there should be a constitutional amendment protecting a person's right to do what they want with their own body, particularly prior to the point where they are carrying another *viable* life.  No state should be able to write laws that make it more difficult to get an abortion under the guise of ""protecting women"" when it is a fact that abortions performed in the developed world are among the safest procedures in medicine.",1
"If you remove the ""christian"" qualifier, you can see what a self-evident statement that is.  Progressives are consistently at the forefront of social justice?  YOU DON'T SAY!  [How come this headline gets to be President of Tautology Club?? ](http://xkcd. com/703/) Huh?  ;]",1
I mean if Obama can win one...,1
who gets the money and how do you determine when they don't get anymore money?,0
"Zimmerman didn’t claim Stand Your Ground, just the same run-of-the-mill Self Defense every other state has.",0
"If he wants to keep it secret, the word wouldn't get out.",1
"I love how they at the end, they pull out a stuck Hummer.",0
I like how the second poll doesn't give an option to blame congressional Democrats.,1
The GOP is a steadily shrinking party so they are desperately putting up walls to cling to power as long as possible.,0
The TPP is a knockout blow to US manufacturing; in its beaten state idk if US manufacturing can make a comeback.,0
"Why would you buy this, and what would you do with it?",0
You are using stereotypes to fight racism.  Bravo,1
Feels good to have a spine.   They come in handy when needed.,1
"Forgot to mention in the title, this is an x-post from /r/BasicIncome",0
And possibly feels guilty that he resides in and makes his living from the high-income class?,0
"Took me awhile, but I see what you did there.",0
"It surprises me that Republican congressmen use visual aids like this.  It just seems to be contradicting their talking points essentially telling Obama to butt out and concentrate on foreign affairs, leaving domestic issues to Congress.  But then they spend hours on the floor complaining about him negotiating with foreign leaders instead of acting as a liaison between Democrats and Republicans in Congress.  I just wish Republicans would pick one or the other and run with it.  *Edit for grammar",1
"&gt; People shouldn't be so surprised by this, as guaranteed basic income is a policy that appeals to both conservatives and liberals.  It's anti-bureaucratic and simple and is a very effective anti-poverty measure So is universal healthcare yet....",1
This was what folks didn't understand about the last raise on incomes over $400k (and the Pubbies exploited to the hilt).,0
Heaven forbid that those kids might be allowed to actually think for themselves.,1
I am an American Jew and I call on the people of Israel to get rid of Netanyahu and other right-wingers.,1
Not sure if /r/conspiracy or /r/conservative,0
Wasn't it in this same interview he says he believes in god?  Lol,1
"It would have been nice for the photo to be captioned with an explanation of the infamous event being depicted: Ryan ""washes"" already clean dishes at a soup kitchen that he made reopen late for his photo-op.",1
Can't wait for Season Two.,0
Can't access the site anyway; it says the security certificate has been revoked.,0
Conservative response: herp derp Detroit hurr durr,1
"Unmarried sex is only bad if the female has an orgasm, because women are sinful vile things who don't deserve enjoyment.",1
"I was so excited to get on there for my husband to see what he will qualify for, but there are just too many people trying to use it right now.",0
Ha!  Gaaaayyyy,1
I like this video but not as much as the one where he promises to end wire tapping.  Although the one about closing gitmo asap was good too.  It ties for my other favorite which is where he claimed Libya was caused by a video.  But you cant forget about his bailouts those videos are always worth a watch after all he kept Detroit running.  You can not mention favorite videos tho without talking about his absolute disgust of raising the debt limit while a part time congress person.,1
"FYI, the 'tiny fraction' isn't the 1%.",0
You should do a post on your past experiences on navigating without health insurance and then your experiences on the ACA process you've so far encountered.,0
He's no Mark Warner but he's also no Cuccinelli.,1
"I didn't start out that way and I don't really have to stay that way, but distributors are going to have a murderous time competing with the convenience and ease of use offered by most pirating methods.",0
I have had one for almost a year and I don't think that I have even ever plugged it in...,1
