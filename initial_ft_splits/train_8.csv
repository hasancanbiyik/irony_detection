"I think just as tons of more ""liberal"" people have been twisting the Pope's words for sensationalist headlines (and then when corrected seem to blame anything or anyone other than their own initial misconception), this is also a pretty sensationalist headline from the other side.   I think this article is *slightly* more honest than the NY Times or Huffington Post was (not saying much), it still misses the point entirely.   Vatican Headline:  ""Pope: Lord save us from the subtle conspiracies of worldliness"" AsiaNews Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"", ""fruit of the spirit of the world that negotiates everything” even faith"" Free Republic Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"" (Slams progressives)"" The Gateway Pundit (posted to r/Christianity): ""POPE FRANCIS Blasts Progressive Movement – “The Fruit of the Devil”"" And of course the latter will get more pageclicks, just like ""Pope Says Church Is ‘Obsessed’ With Gays, Abortion and Birth Control"" got way way more pageclicks than ""A Big Heart Open to God"".     *Worldliness* is the Spirit of the Devil.   Some progressives consider any proverbial ""move forward"" as being more important than their own fidelity to the Faith.

"&gt;In dentists’ and doctors’ offices, hearing aid centers and pain clinics, American health care is forging a lucrative alliance with American finance.  A growing number of health care professionals are urging patients to pay for treatment not covered by their insurance plans with credit cards and lines of credit that can be arranged quickly in the provider’s office.  The cards and loans, which were first marketed about a decade ago for cosmetic surgery and other elective procedures, are now proliferating among older Americans, who often face large out-of-pocket expenses for basic care that is not covered by Medicare or private insurance.

"It's sad that low-information liberals don't get the idea that stand your ground is the means for poor people to protect themselves from others attempting to bully them.   Stand your ground means you don't have to turn your back on a threat, which is often the worst thing you can do.  Having to be forced in the time of danger to try to determine if your back is truly against the wall (figuratively) in the face of a threat.   If the situation between the black young man and a Hispanic guy were switched, and the hispanic was driving the black guy's head into the asphalt for no reason other than his own rage, the vast majority of America would support the black man using lethal force to save his own life.  If you aren't in favor of stand your ground, you're either ignorant or you've got a gun control agenda.",1

Good news, there's a procedure available that smashes the stone, but you have to be anesthetized, needs more tests before we can put you out, bloodwork, EKG...  Another couple hundred dollars.  And the procedure?   I will owe 20%, which is $3000.  I don't have another $3000, so I can't really afford to have it done.   Am I risking future kidney function?   Possibly, yes.  Total bill for kidney stone:  $5000 $6000 for insurance $11,000 Total, if I want treatment.   If not, suffer.   I can't currently afford it, so....  Awesome, huh?
