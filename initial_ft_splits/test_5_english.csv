"Considering President Obama's first term began in the throes of the Great Recession and recovery stimulus was compromised down to be less effective, it should have been clear to all from this beginning what the conservative goals were, and what they were willing to do to achieve them.",0
"The point of the article is that while everyone (outside of the Fox bubble) understands that it is an astro-turf group funded by billionaires, many progressives see tea-party supporters as uninformed, low income fools who are working against their own best interest.
