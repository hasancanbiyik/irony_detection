I think this article is *slightly* more honest than the NY Times or Huffington Post was (not saying much), it still misses the point entirely.   Vatican Headline:  ""Pope: Lord save us from the subtle conspiracies of worldliness"" AsiaNews Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"", ""fruit of the spirit of the world that negotiates everything” even faith"" Free Republic Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"" (Slams progressives)"" The Gateway Pundit (posted to r/Christianity): ""POPE FRANCIS Blasts Progressive Movement – “The Fruit of the Devil”"" And of course the latter will get more pageclicks, just like ""Pope Says Church Is ‘Obsessed’ With Gays, Abortion and Birth Control"" got way way more pageclicks than ""A Big Heart Open to God"".     *Worldliness* is the Spirit of the Devil.

Having to be forced in the time of danger to try to determine if your back is truly against the wall (figuratively) in the face of a threat.   If the situation between the black young man and a Hispanic guy were switched, and the hispanic was driving the black guy's head into the asphalt for no reason other than his own rage, the vast majority of America would support the black man using lethal force to save his own life.

"I prefer it!  I'm a Texan and a while back I had a HORRIBLE kidney stone but I didn't know what it was because I had never had one before, I went to the ER in EXCRUCIATING pain and they treated me wonderfully!  I got three, count 'em baby three, shots of morphine through an IV, that is an experience I have never had before but enjoyed and would recommend!  Then I left with a handful of prescriptions after a CT scan (is that right?  Some kind of scan! ) and went home and was high as a kite for a few days and then it passed and we were all good again.  Woo!  So then the bill comes and it's $8000!  So at first I was all like ""woah, shit"" so I called and complained because while in the ER I had specifically ask, repeatedly, how much the scan would cost and had repeatedly had my question refused to be answered by the doctors, nurses, radiologists (or whatever they're called) and even the lady who came in to get my personal info and ask me for a credit card to pay ""as much as I could afford right now"" (I authorized 50$ because she wouldn't explain to me what exactly it was I was paying for ""right now"" and I finally decided they just wanted a card on file).  Sooo when the bill comes the scan ALONE was 6000 bucks, just the scan, the entire rest of my treatment was only 2000 which I would probably have paid gladly after the wonderful care I got (and I knew I was uninsured going into this and I knew ERs are expensive and at the time I was in HORRIBLE pain and scared shitless by it so I didn't care).  I made my choices and would live with them but 6 grand for JUST THE SCAN?  That seemed unreasonable to me and I also found out later that scans like that aren't necessary for kidney stones and often aren't done unless you're peeing blood, so wtf?  So this is where the fun starts, I called to complain about this scan cost, I was quite clear that I would pay a reasonable about for my care and was happy with my care but I couldn't afford 8000 total and that 6k for the scan was nuts, so they ask me to fill out some paperwork to see if I qualified for ""financial relief"" from my bill.  I explained again that I didn't want charity, I just wanted a reasonable bill (and BTW, 2000 for the three shots of morhpine and the 10 minutes the doctor spent with me seems a little out of whack too, 800 of that is called an ""ER fee"" and is apparently a charge you get just for walking into the ER regardless of what happens next, but hey they took good care of me and I don't know what the fuck morphine costs).  Anyway the only option I had was to file for the charitable relief, well ya see I am currently a ""stay at home uncle"" my brother abandoned his two kids with our mom, she can't afford day care (you would not fucking believe how expensive day care is) and since I made less money than she does, I become the stay at home parent.  We all live together now, she pays the bills and I take care of the kids.  It was weird at first but it's actually kinda rewarding and fun now (most of the time).  So technically I'm single with no income and have been for about a year and a half now and my tax returns reflect that.  Actually do have some income for contract IT work with people who knew me before I quit, it's all under the table though.  Soooo I got FULL relief.  I actually have some money and my mother actually makes ""ok"" money and we were willing to pay a reasonable amount for the bill (my hope was to reduce it by half to 4k and pay it out over time, lower is better of course but I had braced myself to accept 4 grand if I could negotiate hard enough to get there).  Instead I paid 0$.  And I learned a valuable lesson, if it looks like you have no money you can go to the ER for freeeeee!  Wee!  So suck it tax payers I ripped you off for 8000 bucks and I have three pain pills left over for a rainy day!  Now stupid Obamacare is going to make me pay for my own insurance :( boooo That's going to be like 70$ a month.  EVERY month!  You even have to pay in December!  Come on government, it's baby Jesus birthday, fucking dicks.",1

"Believe me, I was furious when our ""socialist"" (I can't roll my eyes at that hard enough) president took single payer off the table before anyone even had to ask him to take it off the table.  We should have nationalized healthcare like every other civilized nation on the planet, but apparently my fellow Americans just don't want it.  They're barely willing to tolerate the incredibly mild reforms in the ACA.  Hell, people are furious at the president because their terrible fake insurance is being replaced by cheaper insurance that actually insures them.  ""But but but you said I could keep eating dirt and paying for the privilege if I wanted!  Liar!  Liar! "" We've been trying for single payer since Teddy Roosevelt's day, and it got him kicked out of his own party.  This sort of ""everything new is pants-pissingly terrifying"" mindset is why we still won't use the damn metric system.  As much as I think my country NEEDS single payer, realistically I have to admit that the majority of us apparently don't WANT it, so I'll take whatever petty improvements we can get.",1
