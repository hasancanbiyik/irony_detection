"Perfect example: me.  I pay about $6000 per year for health insurance.    Never had to use it until this year.   (Pain in kidney area, trace amount of blood in urine, dehydrated a lot, working outdoors in the south) Gee, I bet I have a kidney stone...  Google agrees $6000 insurance $1000 deductible $1000 in co-pays, 20% of bills for cancer tests, two rounds of x-rays, ultrasound, etc...  $8000 paid so far.   Guess what?   I have a kidney stone.  Good news, there's a procedure available that smashes the stone, but you have to be anesthetized, needs more tests before we can put you out, bloodwork, EKG...  Another couple hundred dollars.  And the procedure?   I will owe 20%, which is $3000.  I don't have another $3000, so I can't really afford to have it done.   Am I risking future kidney function?   Possibly, yes.  Total bill for kidney stone:  $5000 $6000 for insurance $11,000 Total, if I want treatment.   If not, suffer.   I can't currently afford it, so....  Awesome, huh?  EDIT: Oh BTW, my deductible re-sets at the first of the year, so if I don't get this done before xmas, it will cost $1000 more next year.  TL:DR Fuck you America.   Get your shit together.",1

"It's sad that low-information liberals don't get the idea that stand your ground is the means for poor people to protect themselves from others attempting to bully them.   Stand your ground means you don't have to turn your back on a threat, which is often the worst thing you can do.  Having to be forced in the time of danger to try to determine if your back is truly against the wall (figuratively) in the face of a threat.   If the situation between the black young man and a Hispanic guy were switched, and the hispanic was driving the black guy's head into the asphalt for no reason other than his own rage, the vast majority of America would support the black man using lethal force to save his own life.  If you aren't in favor of stand your ground, you're either ignorant or you've got a gun control agenda.",1

"In truth this has nothing to do with lobbying or cynical politics.  The uniforms created 8 years ago were horribly designed.  They universally stood out in every environment.  Supposedly the army did their extensive testing on colors and patterns to arrive at good uniform.  But then some top brass ordered them to use the marine digicam pattern (because it's cool and good for recruitment presumably) but to keep the new army colors.  Colors need to be designed specific to a pattern, hence the most ineffective cam since the British invaded (ok, slight overstatement).  This time I hope they do it right.

As someone from outside the US it is just absolutely alien that people are on the streets with placards complaining about ""socialism"" especially when you see the exact people who are the ones protesting.  I was in the US recently and I took a cab in St Louis, the cab driver was an older American who had bad health little or no healthcare as I understood it but he spent the entire journey complaining about socialism.  As a Swede/Brit/European my head just cannot get around the concept of someone whose life would be orders of magnitude better complaining about socialist beliefs.

"I think just as tons of more ""liberal"" people have been twisting the Pope's words for sensationalist headlines (and then when corrected seem to blame anything or anyone other than their own initial misconception), this is also a pretty sensationalist headline from the other side.   I think this article is *slightly* more honest than the NY Times or Huffington Post was (not saying much), it still misses the point entirely.   Vatican Headline:  ""Pope: Lord save us from the subtle conspiracies of worldliness"" AsiaNews Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"", ""fruit of the spirit of the world that negotiates everything” even faith"" Free Republic Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"" (Slams progressives)"" The Gateway Pundit (posted to r/Christianity): ""POPE FRANCIS Blasts Progressive Movement – “The Fruit of the Devil”"" And of course the latter will get more pageclicks, just like ""Pope Says Church Is ‘Obsessed’ With Gays, Abortion and Birth Control"" got way way more pageclicks than ""A Big Heart Open to God"".     *Worldliness* is the Spirit of the Devil.   Some progressives consider any proverbial ""move forward"" as being more important than their own fidelity to the Faith.   (You can see this sometimes in other threads on r/Christianity--""the church needs to 'catch up' to the rest of the culture on ______ issue! "")  This is a product of worldliness.",1

"From user tilio who deleted his comment after realizing how stupid it was,""as the other side of ""independent,"" i feel the exact opposite.  we're 17 trillion in debt with over 70 trillion in unfunded liabilities (medicare is once again, almost bankrupt).  instead of making efforts to work these down, democrats are piling on even more debt.  it's clear that many democrats / fiscal authoritarians have not looked at this from our point of view.  republicans, tea, and fiscal conservatives in general want spending cuts and deficit reduction.  as long as we stand firm, we win.  either democrats cave to our demands (giving us the spending cuts we want), or democrats drive us off the cliff, destroying the US credit rating, forcing spending cuts because they won't be able to borrow nearly as much money.  the only way we lose is to agree to let democrats / fiscal authoritarians to keep spending.  you may dislike this point of view.  but it is inescapable fact. "" Your joking right?   That debt is largely a legacy of the last president and his two wars, which we had to continue.   Conservative fiscal ideas are what drove us over the edge.   Furthermore, we know your position, but you lost, the majority of voters elected representatives that support the ACA, as evidenced by the wast of time that the republicans tried to remote on it and lost every time.   This is a democracy, just because the majority disagrees with you doesn't mean you get to shut down government and act like a bunch of spoiled children.",1
