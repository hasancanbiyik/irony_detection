The overwhelming evidence that the world rejects her ideas only servers as proof, to her, of  righteousness.

"http://afrocityblog. files. wordpress. com/2009/04/black-man-tea-party. jpg maybe if you had socialism people would be able to put their apostrophe in the right place.  As someone from outside the US it is just absolutely alien that people are on the streets with placards complaining about ""socialism"" especially when you see the exact people who are the ones protesting.  I was in the US recently and I took a cab in St Louis, the cab driver was an older American who had bad health little or no healthcare as I understood it but he spent the entire journey complaining about socialism.  As a Swede/Brit/European my head just cannot get around the concept of someone whose life would be orders of magnitude better complaining about socialist beliefs.  The ruling classes have through a very cunning media campaign managed to dupe the working classes.",1
