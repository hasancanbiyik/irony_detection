"Perfect example: me.  I pay about $6000 per year for health insurance.    Never had to use it until this year.   (Pain in kidney area, trace amount of blood in urine, dehydrated a lot, working outdoors in the south) Gee, I bet I have a kidney stone...  Google agrees $6000 insurance $1000 deductible $1000 in co-pays, 20% of bills for cancer tests, two rounds of x-rays, ultrasound, etc...  $8000 paid so far.   Guess what?   I have a kidney stone.  Good news, there's a procedure available that smashes the stone, but you have to be anesthetized, needs more tests before we can put you out, bloodwork, EKG...  Another couple hundred dollars.  And the procedure?   I will owe 20%, which is $3000.  I don't have another $3000, so I can't really afford to have it done.   Am I risking future kidney function?   Possibly, yes.  Total bill for kidney stone:  $5000 $6000 for insurance $11,000 Total, if I want treatment.   If not, suffer.   I can't currently afford it, so....  Awesome, huh?  EDIT: Oh BTW, my deductible re-sets at the first of the year, so if I don't get this done before xmas, it will cost $1000 more next year.  TL:DR Fuck you America.   Get your shit together.",1

"Well, to me the immediate problem is that it's faulty to view God as a being among other beings.  God is more like being-itself.  Thus by definition you can't really have a God-eating-penguin.

"It's sad that low-information liberals don't get the idea that stand your ground is the means for poor people to protect themselves from others attempting to bully them.   Stand your ground means you don't have to turn your back on a threat, which is often the worst thing you can do.  Having to be forced in the time of danger to try to determine if your back is truly against the wall (figuratively) in the face of a threat.   If the situation between the black young man and a Hispanic guy were switched, and the hispanic was driving the black guy's head into the asphalt for no reason other than his own rage, the vast majority of America would support the black man using lethal force to save his own life.  If you aren't in favor of stand your ground, you're either ignorant or you've got a gun control agenda.",1
