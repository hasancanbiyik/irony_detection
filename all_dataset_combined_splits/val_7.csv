"It's sad that low-information liberals don't get the idea that stand your ground is the means for poor people to protect themselves from others attempting to bully them.   Stand your ground means you don't have to turn your back on a threat, which is often the worst thing you can do.  Having to be forced in the time of danger to try to determine if your back is truly against the wall (figuratively) in the face of a threat.   If the situation between the black young man and a Hispanic guy were switched, and the hispanic was driving the black guy's head into the asphalt for no reason other than his own rage, the vast majority of America would support the black man using lethal force to save his own life.  If you aren't in favor of stand your ground, you're either ignorant or you've got a gun control agenda.",1
