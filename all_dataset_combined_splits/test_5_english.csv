"I think just as tons of more ""liberal"" people have been twisting the Pope's words for sensationalist headlines (and then when corrected seem to blame anything or anyone other than their own initial misconception), this is also a pretty sensationalist headline from the other side.   I think this article is *slightly* more honest than the NY Times or Huffington Post was (not saying much), it still misses the point entirely.   Vatican Headline:  ""Pope: Lord save us from the subtle conspiracies of worldliness"" AsiaNews Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"", ""fruit of the spirit of the world that negotiates everything” even faith"" Free Republic Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"" (Slams progressives)"" The Gateway Pundit (posted to r/Christianity): ""POPE FRANCIS Blasts Progressive Movement – “The Fruit of the Devil”"" And of course the latter will get more pageclicks, just like ""Pope Says Church Is ‘Obsessed’ With Gays, Abortion and Birth Control"" got way way more pageclicks than ""A Big Heart Open to God"".     *Worldliness* is the Spirit of the Devil.   Some progressives consider any proverbial ""move forward"" as being more important than their own fidelity to the Faith.   (You can see this sometimes in other threads on r/Christianity--""the church needs to 'catch up' to the rest of the culture on ______ issue! "")  This is a product of worldliness.",1

But then some top brass ordered them to use the marine digicam pattern (because it's cool and good for recruitment presumably) but to keep the new army colors.  Colors need to be designed specific to a pattern, hence the most ineffective cam since the British invaded (ok, slight overstatement).  This time I hope they do it right.

The 1% would be even more grossly over represented than they already are and have even more of an advantage than they already do.,1
